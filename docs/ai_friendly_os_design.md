# Ainux: AI-Friendly Operating System Concept

## Vision
Ainux aims to be an AI-native desktop operating system where natural language
requests can drive full-system automation. Users describe intentions, and the
OS orchestrates the right applications, services, and workflows to complete
those tasks autonomously while keeping the user in control.

## Design Principles
- **User-first autonomy**: The AI should execute multi-step tasks on the
  user's behalf but surface plans, confirmations, and outcomes at every
  critical decision point.
- **Contextual awareness**: Maintain rich state about active files,
  applications, and user preferences so that AI reasoning always has the right
  context.
- **Composable intelligence**: Combine deterministic system services with
  LLM-based planning so that actions remain reliable, explainable, and
  repeatable.
- **Security & privacy by default**: Use sandboxed execution, fine-grained
  permission prompts, and data minimization to keep user data safe.
- **Transparency**: Log every AI-generated action with rationale so users can
  audit and refine future behavior.

## High-Level Architecture
1. **AI Orchestration Layer**
   - Intent parser converts natural language commands into structured tasks.
   - Planner decomposes tasks into ordered system actions with fallbacks.
   - Critic/safety module evaluates plans for policy or permission violations
     before execution.
2. **Context Fabric**
   - Unified knowledge graph indexing files, system settings, application
     states, and recent interactions.
   - Event bus streams updates (file changes, notifications, sensor data) to
     keep AI models synchronized with reality.
3. **Action Execution Engine**
   - Library of capability adapters that wrap OS APIs, CLI tools, and app
     automations.
   - Transaction manager ensures multi-step operations can roll back safely on
     failure.
4. **Human Feedback Interface**
   - Conversational UI blending chat, voice, and visual prompts.
   - Explanation panels showing the planned steps, required permissions, and
     live progress updates.

## Operating Modes
- **Assist Mode**: AI drafts plans and awaits explicit approval before each
  execution.
- **Autopilot Mode**: AI proceeds automatically within a user-defined scope
  (time window, specific apps) and only interrupts on errors or escalations.
- **Training Mode**: Users walk through workflows manually while the system
  records them as automations that the AI can later replay and adapt.

## Workflow Lifecycle
1. Capture user intent (text/voice) and snapshot relevant context.
2. Generate and simulate the execution plan.
3. Request permissions where needed and log approvals.
4. Execute actions, streaming updates and handling exceptions.
5. Summarize outcomes, collect feedback, and learn adjustments for next time.

## Safety & Governance
- Permission model tied to identity, device posture, and data sensitivity.
- Policy engine to enforce organizational or parental controls on AI actions.
- Immutable audit trail with explainability metadata for each automation.
- Offline/air-gapped inference option for sensitive environments.

## Extensibility
- Plugin SDK so developers can expose new capabilities with declarative
  schemas describing inputs, outputs, and safety constraints.
- Model abstraction layer supporting multiple LLM providers and local models.
- Automation marketplace for sharing vetted workflows.

## Example Scenarios
- "정리 안 된 다운로드 폴더를 폴더별로 정리해줘" → AI groups files by type,
  creates folders, confirms summary, and executes organization.
- "금요일 회의 준비해줘" → Gathers documents, drafts agenda, schedules calendar
  reminders, and assembles a briefing package.
- "새로운 개발 환경 만들어줘" → Provisions containers, installs dependencies,
  configures editors, and verifies setup with smoke tests.

## Roadmap Highlights
- MVP: Natural language command shell with deterministic action templates.
- Beta: Context fabric integration, audit logging, and plugin SDK.
- 1.0: Full autopilot workflows with adaptive learning and enterprise
  governance features.
