# Ainux Ubuntu Remix Builder

This directory contains automation to assemble an Ubuntu-based live ISO that
bootstraps the AI-native workflows documented in `docs/ai_friendly_os_design.md`.
The process **never modifies the host operating system**; all work happens in a
temporary `work/` tree and the result is a standalone ISO image you can flash or
boot in other environments. The scripts rely on `debootstrap` and the standard
Ubuntu live ISO toolchain, allowing you to customize the distribution while
maintaining compatibility with upstream updates.

## Features

* Uses Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (`jammy`) as the baseline.
* Installs the Ainux automation stack (Ansible, Python tooling, telemetry
  helpers) plus NVIDIA drivers, CUDA toolkit, and container runtime support.
* Preloads infrastructure scheduling toolchain (SLURM clients, networking
  diagnostics, IPMI utilities) so AI agents can coordinate complex hardware
  operations out-of-the-box.
* Seeds a default `ainux` operator account with configuration derived from the
  design document (automation profile, accelerator provisioning defaults).
* Bundles the `ainux-client` CLI (with an `ainux-ai-chat` alias) so the live system can authenticate to
  OpenAI-compatible GPT endpoints and capture transcripts for auditing.
* Installs the context fabric toolkit so operators can snapshot files, settings,
  and events for AI-driven workflows.
* Ships the hardware automation service (inventory scanner, driver/firmware
  catalog, telemetry collector) so GPU/accelerator upkeep can run hands-free.
* Ships a browser-based orchestration studio so operators can review natural
  language conversations, plans, and execution logs side-by-side.
* Hardened SSH configuration and MOTD branding.
* Generates both GRUB and ISOLINUX boot loaders for BIOS/UEFI compatibility.

## Prerequisites

Run the build on an Ubuntu (or Debian-based) machine with the following
packages installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso isolinux \
  grub-pc-bin grub-efi-amd64-bin mtools rsync
```

You must execute the build as `root` (or via `sudo`) because debootstrap and the
ISO generation steps require elevated privileges.

## Directory Layout

```
build/ubuntu-ainux/
├── build.sh               # Primary orchestration script
├── config/
│   ├── packages.txt       # Extra packages installed inside the live system
│   ├── chroot_setup.sh    # Additional configuration executed in the chroot
│   ├── sources.list       # Custom apt mirror definition
│   └── (optional) grub.cfg for further boot menu customization
└── overlay/               # Drop-in files copied into the root filesystem
```

Populate the `overlay/` directory with configuration snippets, systemd units, or
other files that should be injected into the root filesystem verbatim.

## Building the ISO

> ⚠️ **리소스 경고:** debootstrap, SquashFS 압축, ISO 패키징 과정은 수 기가바이트의
> 디스크 공간과 높은 CPU/메모리 사용률을 요구합니다. 운영 중인 서버에서는
> 빌드를 실행하지 말고, 전용 빌드 박스나 임시 VM을 사용하세요. 실수로 실행하는
> 일을 막기 위해 `build.sh`는 기본적으로 종료하며, 안전하다고 판단되는 환경에서
> `AINUX_ALLOW_BUILD=1`을 지정해야만 진행됩니다.

```bash
cd build/ubuntu-ainux
sudo AINUX_ALLOW_BUILD=1 ./build.sh --release jammy --arch amd64 --output ~/ainux-jammy.iso
```

The script streams all output to `/tmp/ainux-build.log` (override with
`AINUX_BUILD_LOG`) so you can review progress or diagnose failures if the run is
interrupted. Expect status lines such as `[bootstrap]`, `[overlay]`, and
`[squashfs]` as each phase completes.

The script creates a `work/` directory containing the debootstrap chroot and ISO
staging tree. By default the directory is removed on success. Pass `--keep-work`
if you want to inspect the intermediate artifacts.

The resulting ISO can be booted in a virtual machine or written to a USB drive
for bare-metal installation/testing:

```bash
sudo dd if=~/ainux-jammy.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

## Extending the Build

* **Additional Packages:** Add them to `config/packages.txt` (one per line).
* **Post-Install Logic:** Modify `config/chroot_setup.sh` to run extra commands
  inside the chroot. For complex flows consider invoking Ansible playbooks.
* **Hardware Blueprints:** Place YAML or JSON templates inside `overlay/` or
  extend the provided examples in `/usr/local/share/ainux/playbooks/`.

### AI-Orchestrated Scheduling Commands

The chroot customization seeds three helper commands exposed to the default
`ainux` user. Each is a thin wrapper around the matching `ainux-client`
subcommand (the legacy `ainux-ai-chat` alias is still provided) so you get
identical behaviour on the host and inside the live ISO:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ainux-scheduler` | Proxy for `ainux-client scheduler`, covering blueprint execution, SLURM job submission, status/cancel flows, and maintenance-window logging tied to the context fabric. |
| `ainux-network-orchestrator` | Proxy for `ainux-client network`, managing declarative network profiles (interfaces, VLANs, QoS, nftables rules) with dry-run previews. |
| `ainux-cluster-health` | Proxy for `ainux-client cluster`, generating single-shot or streaming health snapshots that include load, memory, GPUs, scheduler queues, and interface counters. |

Blueprint samples live under `/usr/local/share/ainux/playbooks/` inside the ISO
and are implemented as Ansible playbooks so they can be versioned and audited.
Extend or replace them to reflect your infrastructure requirements; the Python
services resolve additional paths such as `~/.config/ainux/playbooks` so local
customisations are automatically discovered.

### GPT API bootstrap

The live system ships with `/usr/local/bin/ainux-client` (plus a compatibility
symlink `/usr/local/bin/ainux-ai-chat`), a wrapper around the Python module
located at `/usr/local/lib/ainux/ainux_ai`. Configure an API key once and the
chat client becomes available to automations and shell workflows:

```bash
ainux-client configure --default          # prompt for key/model/base URL
ainux-client set-key --api-key sk-new-... # rotate the stored API key later
ainux-client chat --message "GPU 상태 점검 루틴 만들어줘"
ainux-client orchestrate "CUDA 스택을 최신화해줘" --dry-run
```

For unattended scripts, export credentials via environment variables prior to
invocation (e.g., `AINUX_GPT_API_KEY`, `AINUX_GPT_MODEL`, `AINUX_GPT_BASE_URL`).

Transcripts generated by `ainux-client` can be persisted by passing
`--history /var/log/ainux/chat.jsonl`, enabling compliance teams to audit
intent capture and responses alongside infrastructure actions. The
`orchestrate` subcommand prints structured plans and execution logs; combine it
with `--json` to export data into other observability systems.

### Context fabric state management

The live image seeds `~/.config/ainux/context_fabric.json` for the `ainux`
operator. Use the bundled CLI to inspect or extend the shared knowledge graph
that powers orchestration:

```bash
ainux-client context snapshot --limit-events 10
ainux-client context ingest-file /etc/ainux/profile.yaml --label profile --tag bootstrap
ainux-client context record-event maintenance.completed --data '{"status": "ok"}'
ainux-client orchestrate "GPU 재부팅 후 상태 보고서 작성" --use-fabric
```

All context changes are persisted back to the JSON state file so subsequent
sessions and automation runs have access to the latest system view.

### Hardware automation toolkit

The live image exposes `ainux-client hardware` and a convenience alias
`ainux-hw`. The command family can refresh the hardware inventory, manage the
driver/firmware catalog, generate dependency-aware install plans, and capture
telemetry snapshots:

```bash
ainux-hw scan --json                # merge detected devices into the catalog
ainux-hw catalog drivers            # review driver blueprints shipped on the ISO
ainux-hw plan --apply --dry-run     # preview the commands required for updates
ainux-hw telemetry --samples 5      # collect health metrics (records fabric events)
```

Use `--catalog-path` to place the JSON catalog on shared storage and
`--fabric-path` to reuse a remote context fabric. When run without `--no-fabric`
the CLI logs inventory refreshes, catalog changes, and plan execution summaries
to the shared knowledge graph so the orchestrator and browser studio surface a
complete hardware timeline.

### Browser orchestration studio

The live image exposes `/usr/local/bin/ainux-client ui`, and the default shell
profile creates a short alias `ainux-ui`. Launching the command starts a local
web server (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787`) that renders a glassmorphism UI
with three synchronized panes. Release 0.7 embeds the square Ainux logo and
penguin mascot as base64 assets so the hero banner and floating mascot always
render, while the build optionally copies overrides from `folder/` into
`/usr/share/ainux/branding` to mirror your customized desktop experience:

1. 자연어 대화 타임라인 – 사용자 프롬프트, 실행 모드, 경고 배지를 카드로 표시합니다.
2. 계획·명령 로그 – 승인/차단 여부와 실행 결과를 단계별로 정리합니다.
3. 컨텍스트 패브릭 현황 – 저장 경로, 노드/엣지/이벤트 수, 최근 이벤트 타임라인을
   즉시 확인할 수 있습니다.

UI 하단의 토글로 드라이런/실행, 오프라인 모드, 패브릭 사용 여부를 즉시 조정할
수 있으며, 배경에 사용되는 로고/마스코트 이미지는 `/usr/share/ainux/branding`
을 교체하면 즉시 반영됩니다. 브라우저를 열지 않고 서버만 띄우고 싶다면
`ainux-ui --no-browser` 또는 원격 포트 포워딩과 함께 사용할 수 있습니다.

This initial build pipeline establishes the foundation for an Ubuntu-based
Ainux operating system. The seeded orchestrator offers a first pass at turning
자연어 요청 into actionable plans; future iterations will attach deeper
hardware provisioning agents, user-facing orchestrators, and UI layers defined
in the overarching architecture document.
